To catch exceptions in eval-top-level, I added appropriate cases to the with-handler in racket-compile-eval
Runtime errors:
    - Division by zero. Fixed by adding a check in header.cpp and halting with an error message if b = 0.
    - Memory cap. Fixed in header.cpp by keeping track of the amount of memory allocated and terminating if it 
      goes over the 256 MB limit.
    - Applying non-function value. Fixed in top-level.rkt by surrounding every function application with a check 
      to make sure that the first value is actually a procedure.
